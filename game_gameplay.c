/* DEV NOTES FOR THIS FILE:
 * 
 * This file contains the core frame-by-frame gameplay systems that run while
 * the player is inside a playable level. its job is to coordinate movement,
 * camera behavior, background scrolling, and the high-level gameplay checks
 * that need to happen every frame.
 *
 * More specifically, this file handles:
 * - the shared gameplay loop used by all playable states
 * - player movement input and movement resolution
 * - jump, gravity, and climb behavior
 * - the ladder / beanstalk top-exit anti-stuck logic
 * - player animation timing
 * - enemy update calls
 * - item pickup and resource deposit checks
 * - level transitions
 * - camera tracking and scrolling
 * - parallax cloud movement
 * - win and lose condition checks
 *
 * In the larger scope of the game:
 * - state-management code decides which screen or mode the game is in
 * - collision/world helper code answers whether movement is allowed
 * - rendering code draws the world after these gameplay systems update state
 * - this file is the main "live gameplay" controller that connects all of that :)
