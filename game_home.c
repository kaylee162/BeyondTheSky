/* DEV NOTES FOR THIS FILE:
 *
 * This file is in charge of all the parts of the game that are unique to the
 * homebase map (which is mainly the farmland and beanstalk progression system).
 * Unlike the regular level maps (l1 & l2), the home map changes at runtime based on what
 * the player has collected and deposited. Because of that, this file acts as
 * the bridge between inventory progression and visible world changes.
 *
 * More specifically, this file handles:
 * - reading original tile entries from the home foreground map
 * - writing updated tile entries directly into the live home foreground map
 * - stamping rectangular tile regions from the tileset into the map
 * - rebuilding the farmland and beanstalk visuals based on growth stage
 * - checking whether the player is standing on the farmland
 * - handling B-button resource deposits in the correct progression order
 * - limiting which parts of the home beanstalk are actually climbable
 *
 * In the larger scope of the game:
 * - collectibles are picked up in the world and stored in inventory elsewhere
 * - this file uses those collected resources to visually and mechanically grow
 *   the beanstalk back in homebase
